                <h2>Graphics</h2>
                <p>What KSP1 really lacked is realism. With that in mind, we developed KSP2 from scratch in such a way, that players will love to explore each and every single detail there is out there, whether it's in the Kerbol system or beyond. Light now travels just like it would in real life using special ray-tracing technology. Textures now offer much more detail, you'll be overwhelmed, even in 8K resolution. And both your jet and plane passengers will now enjoy the views of the clouds and other volumetric particles. </p>

                <h2>Kerbals</h2>
                <p>Does Jebediah Kerman still have his badass poker-face when he's going Mach 10 in Bob's new jet? He sure does! But there's even more! Each Kerbal has their own calculated emotional behavior based on the current conditions and g-forces, making them much more alive-like and it adds to their humor-entertaining level. And they can dance too.</p>

                <h2>User Interface</h2>
                <p>Featuring a new, completely redesigned User Interface, with all the mission-critical details on your screen at a more convenient place. No more endless searching for parts in the VAB. No more obscuring elements on your screen. And it's all been built on the fundamental road to the long-awaited multiplayer. And it comes with color painting tools for your chosen colors too (and Your space program's)! Customization options hopefully coming in the future (definitely with mods).</p>

                <h2>Planets</h2>
                <p>The Kerbol system is suddenly much more appealing to explorers thanks to the new ultra-high detailed textures with more realistic atmospheres based on actual astronomical observings. (and actual rocket engine recordings for the sounds) Have you ever wondered what it's like to be inside planet's rings? Now you can actually go there, because Dres now has some rings of it's own! And gas surfaces have their own animations now too!</p>

                <h2>Planetary Bases</h2>
                <p>Feel like constructing a new base on Duna? Or making a backup colony on Jool's moon Laythe in case something happens to Kerbin? We got you covered! However, creating and maintaining such base or colony is very resource-consuming. But if you unlock enough technology (and have Bob's rocket-science intellect), then you can in-fact transport enough material and crew even to such distant places. But don't forget to bring snacks.</p>

                <h2>In-Orbit Stations</h2>
                <p>What if having a stationary base is too suspectful for your multiplayer enemies or what if it's just not possible in the presence of a cruel gas giant? Just get your whole base into orbit! (or construct it piece by piece) So now your dream of making a space hotel is completely possible!</p>

                <p>Orbital space-stations appear to be amazing as they are, but... Now offering the ability to construct new ships directly from orbit! A game-changer, isn't it? Wernher von Kerman approves.</p>

                <p>Feel like you've already seen all the Kerbol system can offer? What if I told you that you don't have to stay there all the time. That's right! You can explore other solar (and non-solar) systems as soon as they come out! (no one knows when, not even Valentina) And you can bring your space stations, spaceplanes and rockets too, unlocking the colonization and exploration potential even further.</p>

                <h2>The Debdeb System</h2>
                <p>This solar system is your next milestone, one which KSP1 could not offer. Whether you want to explore the "heat blasted world of iron" - Char, or colonize Gurdamma's water filled craters, or just fly-by the new gas giant - Glumo, looking like Saturn. Or visit it's moon Merbel, which may or may not be inclined (and have seas, but Pst!)</p>

                <h2>Upcoming</h2>
                <p>And yet, we're just getting started. The enormous Kerbal-fan community will absolutely be a huge factor when talking about Kerbal Space Program 2. Because it's them that keep the game running years after it's release, and at this point you may know what point I'm getting to - mods. Even if you're not a huge fan of the original solar (and other) systems that the game devs Squad and Intercept Games are planning to create, there will always be modders making this game be a truly spectacular creation full of new experiences.</p>

                <h2>New Frontier</h2>
                <p>All you've seen up to this point is just the beginning. Even if you already explored the Kerbol system, you still haven't seen anything due to it being only one system. Even if you built a base on every planet, you can still put more space stations into orbit, and make them all self-sustaining resource-wise - which will allow creation of new rockets with much greater reach. And even then, if you feel like you've tried all the mods out there. How bout inviting your friends to the game? Or just playing with random players? Now, the options are truly limitless.</p>

                <p>Can't get to orbit? But maybe you can get 80% of the way - in that case, your friend could catch you and get you into orbit - which is something you simply couldn't do by yourself. And what if you wanted to dock two jets while going Mach 3? Now you can! As well as you can just enjoy the entire experience with others. Trading, challenges, speedrunning with friends - all of that is real in KSP2.</p>

                <h2>PvP</h2>
                <p>But maybe you don't want to be friends with anyone. Or you don't have any friends - like Dinkelstein Kerman. Then you can just join a public server and fight em off, and take your place as the interstellar king. Or you can just PVP with your friends against others - that's a great option too! Just think of all the different strategies you could use together. Simply said, bounds not found in this game... (except for the Kraken)</p>
